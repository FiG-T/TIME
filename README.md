# TIME
Temporal Investigation of Mitonuclear Evolution.  A series of scripts for analysing the outputs of a long(ish) term experimental evolution study with D. melanogaster. 

## Overview 
This repo will eventually be split into two halves. These will be dedicated to analysis of phenotypes and genomic analyses respectively. Currently, all scripts written belong to the former, and address the analysis of three different measures of *D. melanogaster* fitness. For more information on each of these, and analysis of fly phenotypes more generally, please see the README.md file within that subfolder. 

These scripts have been written with specific datasets in mind (those generated from a 2 year experimental evolution study). As such, some scripts will need to be tweaked for separate use. Where possible I have tried to make the scripts generalisable and easily adaptable. 

## Notice
All scripts are currently under development and may be subject to change - please let me know if you spot any issues/mistakes (or if you have any questions).
